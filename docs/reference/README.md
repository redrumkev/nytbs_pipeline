## Core Principles
1. Flow State Preservation
   - System operates invisibly in background
   - No technical intervention during creative processes
   - Seamless transitions between thinking and writing

2. Technical Invisibility
   - Complex operations hidden behind simple interfaces
   - Background processing and optimization
   - Self-maintaining and self-healing

3. Performance Priority
   - Optimized for RTX 4090
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Fast vector search and embedding generation

4. Scalability
   - Handles growing content volume
   - Maintains performance under load
   - Efficient resource utilization
