# Active Context: NYTBS Pipeline

## Current Focus

- **Build Minimal Test Suite & Baseline Configuration:**  
  Develop a comprehensive test suite for core components (TextChunker, ModernBERTProcessor, QdrantManager) and set up VS Code tasks to run tests automatically.

## Recent Changes

- QdrantManager class created for connection, collection management, and embedding storage. (Completed)
- ModernBERTProcessor class created for batch and realtime embedding generation. (Completed)
- TextChunker class created for text processing into manageable chunks. (Completed)

## Next Steps

1. **Develop Unit Tests:**  
   Write tests for the TextChunker, ModernBERTProcessor, and QdrantManager that cover both typical and edge-case inputs.
2. **Implement an Integration Test:**  
   Process a set of sample files and validate that embeddings are stored in Qdrant and that search returns semantically relevant results.
3. **Establish Baseline Configuration in VS Code:**  
   Configure tasks (via `.vscode/tasks.json`) and debugging (via `.vscode/launch.json`) to support continuous testing and integration.
4. **Integrate Memory Bank:**  
   Ensure our memory bank (and .clinerules) workflows are used to maintain iterative context for our development tasks.

## Active Decisions

- **Phase 1 Scope:**  
  Focus on core functionality and testing, with future iterations addressing additional features.
- **Data Consistency:**  
  Continue using UUIDs for all entities to maintain consistency across data stores.
