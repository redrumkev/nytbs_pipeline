# Progress: NYTBS Pipeline (Phase 1)

## What Works

- Qdrant Docker container is running and accessible.
- ModernBERT is successfully deployed on CUDA 12.1.
- Embedding generation via ModernBERTProcessor is operational.
- QdrantManager is functional for connection, collection creation, and embedding storage.
- TextChunker reliably processes text into chunks.

## What's Left to Build (Phase 1)

- **Develop a Minimal Test Suite:**  
  - Unit tests for TextChunker (handling empty input, short text, and typical markdown).
  - Unit tests for ModernBERTProcessor (batch and realtime processing, caching behavior).
  - Unit tests for QdrantManager (collection creation, embedding storage/retrieval, and semantic search).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Process sample files from our test directories and verify that embeddings are stored and searchable.
- **Baseline Configuration:**  
  - Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.test.json`) with settings for collection names and test data paths.
  - Set up VS Code tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`) and debugging (`.vscode/launch.json`) for continuous test execution.
- **Frontend & API:**  
  - Build a minimal FastAPI application with the `/api/search` endpoint.
  - Develop a simple React interface for text input and displaying search results.

## Known Issues

- None at this phase â€“ the core components are validated; the focus now is on testing and integration.
