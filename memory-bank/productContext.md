## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to solve the problem of fragmented thoughts and inefficient information retrieval during the writing process.  Traditional note-taking and writing tools often fail to capture the nuances of creative flow and make it difficult to connect disparate ideas.

## Problems It Solves (Phase 1 Focus)

- **Inefficient Note Retrieval:** Difficulty finding relevant notes based on meaning.
- **Lost Ideas:**  Fleeting thoughts that are not captured and integrated into the writing process.
- **Disrupted Flow:**  Technical distractions that interrupt the creative process.

## How It Should Work (Phase 1)

The user should be able to:

1.  Enter text notes through a simple interface.
2.  Submit search queries based on natural language.
3.  Receive a list of semantically similar notes, ranked by relevance.

The underlying technology (embedding, storage, search) should be completely invisible to the user.

## User Experience Goals

- **Zero Friction:**  The system should feel intuitive and natural to use.
- **Instant Results:**  Search results should be returned quickly.
- **Minimal Distraction:**  The interface should be clean and focused on the writing process.

## Future Iterations

Will incorporate dynamic context to help maintain creative flow.
